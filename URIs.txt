URI, URL, URN

- URI = uniform resource identifier; string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet either by name or location (original form, URL and URN to be more specific)

- URL = uniform resource location; string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet either location

- URN = uniform resource name; string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet either by name

- URIs can specify address (URL) or the name (URN) of the resource or both at the same time; URLs mostly used

- A URL consists of required components, which are the protocol (e.g. http, ftp) and the domain (e.g. www.google.com), and optional ones - port(e.g. www.google.com:80), path(e.g. /Downloads/You_Dont_Know_JS_Scope_and_Closures.pdf), query strings (e.g. watch?v=vpYct2npKD8) and fragments (to request a portion of the page e.g. #inbox)
